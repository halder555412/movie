    <h1>3 Idiots</h1>

    <p>
      3 Idiots is a 2009 Indian Hindi-language coming-of-age comedy-drama film
      co-written (with Abhijat Joshi) and directed by Rajkumar Hirani. The film
      stars Aamir Khan, R. Madhavan, Sharman Joshi, Kareena Kapoor, Boman Irani
      and Omi Vaidya. The film follows the friendship of three students at an
      Indian engineering college and is a satire about the social pressures
      under an Indian education system.[6][7][8] The film is narrated through
      parallel dramas, one in the present and the other ten years in the past.
    </p>
    <p>
      Produced by Vidhu Vinod Chopra under the banner Vinod Chopra Films, and
      based on Chetan Bhagat's novel Five Point Someone: What not to do at IIT!
      for which author was not suitably credited,[9][10][11] the film
      incorporated real Indian inventions created by Remya Jose,[12] Mohammad
      Idris,[13] Jahangir Painter[14] and Sonam Wangchuk.[15] It received
      widespread critical[16] and commercial success upon its release on 25
      December 2009. It was also the highest-grossing film in its opening
      weekend in India, had the highest opening day collections for an Indian
      film up until that point and also held the record for the highest net
      collections in the first week for a Bollywood film. It also became one of
      the few Indian films at the time to become successful in East Asian
      markets such as China[17] and Japan,[18] eventually bringing its worldwide
      gross to ₹3.92 billion ($90 million)[a][4][5] — it was the
      highest-grossing Indian film ever at the time.[19] The film also had a
      social impact on attitudes to education in India,[20] as well as education
      in other Asian countries such as China.[7]
    </p>
    <p>
      The film won six Filmfare Awards including Best Film and three National
      Film Awards including Best Popular Film. Overseas, it won the Grand Prize
      at Japan's Videoyasan Awards[21][22][18] while it was nominated for Best
      Outstanding Foreign Language Film at the Japan Academy Awards[23][24] and
      Best Foreign Film at China's Beijing International Film Festival.[25] This
      film was remade in Tamil as Nanban (2012), which also received critical
      praise and commercial success.[26][27] Nanban had a Telugu dubbed version
      titled Snehitudu. A Mexican remake, 3 idiotas, was also released in
      2017.[28]

    <h1>Plot</h1>
    <p>
      Farhan Qureshi (R. Madhavan) is a young man who has just boarded a flight
      which is about to take off when he receives a call from someone who has
      news for him and, upon ending the call, realizes that he needs to get off
      as soon as possible. Since the flight has already taken off, he fakes a
      heart attack to make way for an emergency landing of the plane, and once
      within the airport premises, blows his cover in front of the confused
      medics who try to stop him. However, he escapes to the airport exit,
      faking his identity in the process to find a taxi driver, and calls up his
      friend Raju Rastogi (Sharman Joshi), asking him to be ready soon so he can
      pick him up, as he exclaims that long lost friend, Rancho, has been found.
      Raju joins Farhan, though he amusingly finds out he has forgotten his
      pants in a hurry. They reach the terrace of the Imperial College of
      Engineering, or ICE, their Alma mater, where they find their former
      classmate, Chatur "Silencer" Ramalingam (Omi Vaidya) waiting for them.
      Chatur, who was the one to have called the two, pesters them with details
      of his lavish life in the United States and exclaims that he kept his
      promise of returning to the same location, 10 years after he had
      challenged Rancho with the same. Although Farhan retaliates with Raju
      getting angry, Chatur reveals he knows where Rancho is – he's apparently
      living in Shimla. The trio sets off on a road journey in Chatur's car,
      with Farhan narrating the story of Rancho, who filled his and Raju's lives
      with fun and joy.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the year 1999, Farhan enters the prestigious ICE in Delhi, and meets
      Manmohan a.k.a. "Millimetre", an adolescent boy helping the students with
      random chores, who escorts him to his room. There, he meets his roommate,
      Raju, who constantly engages in religious worship. During the time their
      seniors rag them, a newbie, Ranchhoddas "Rancho" Shamaldas Chanchad (Aamir
      Khan) arrives, and in an attempt to avoid being ragged, injures the head
      senior in the process by pulling off a simple trick. Farhan and Raju soon
      realize that Rancho, new in campus, is their roommate.
    </p>
    <p>
      Millimeter is persuaded by Rancho the next day to sneak into school and
      get educated. While Farhan chose to pursue engineering over his passion
      for photography to appease his father, Raju has taken the course in an
      attempt to end his family's poverty and is always afraid of failing.
      Rancho, on the other hand, is genuinely passionate in science and
      engineering. He believes in hands-on learning and tends to give unorthodox
      answers in class, resulting in him coming into conflict with the
      professors, particularly the institution's director, Viru Sahastrabuddhe
      (Boman Irani), whom the ICE community nicknames "Virus", and whose
      traditional and strict philosophies on education contrast sharply with
      Rancho's carefree love of learning. Meanwhile, Chatur, who has a habit of
      silently farting, is shown to be an arrogant student with little knowledge
      of Hindi due to his Ugandan-Tamilian upbringing, who is obsessed with
      topping the exams and invariably learns by rote.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sometime later, the trio finds that a student named Joy Lobo (Ali Fazal),
      whose interest in machines was as much as Rancho, committed suicide by
      hanging himself, which was caused by depression after Virus informs Joy's
      father that Joy would be unable to graduate that year due to a delay in
      his submission of an assignment. Joy had taken longer as he wanted to
      perfect his breakthrough drone design of a quad-copter, and also due to a
      break on account of his father's brief illness. Rancho criticises Virus'
      method of teaching and tries to show him how much pressure engineers face
      when they study, angering him further. Virus writes a letter to the
      Qureshis and Rastogis, and Rancho visits the two families, though none of
      them is able to pacify his hunger. Rancho suddenly notices a wedding in
      front of him while walking, and the trio then gatecrashes the wedding of
      Virus' elder daughter, Mona to eat good food. They meet and befriend Pia
      (Kareena Kapoor), who Rancho advises not to marry her fiancée, Suhas
      Tandon (Olivier Sanjay Lafont) because he's madly obsessed with expensive
      jewellery, brands, and prices and has no true love for her, by giving a
      demo on Suhas' attitude by spilling mint sauce on his shoes to annoy him.
      As it turns out, Pia is revealed to be Virus' daughter. When Virus spots
      the trio, who find out that the wedding is of Pia's elder sister Mona
      (Mona Singh), he summons Farhan and Raju on the next working day and warns
      them of the consequences of being friends with Rancho by comparing their
      families' incomes. He tells them that Rancho comes from a very rich family
      and does not need to worry about getting good grades and making a career.
    </p>
    <p>
      Affected, Raju moves out and into Chatur's room. During the Teachers Day
      celebration, Chatur is humiliated when he delivers a Hindi speech modified
      by Rancho and as a result, he bets Rancho that ten years later, they would
      see who is more successful. Sometime later, Pia is at the mall with Suhas
      and spots Rancho with an invention named after Virus; The Virus Inverter.
      Rancho explains to Pia that he dislikes the way her father teaches his
      students and that they end up overly materialistic like Suhas. Rancho
      plays a prank on Suhas, pretending that Pia lost her watch, to prove that
      Suhas places more value on expensive things than on her. Fed up with
      Suhas' behaviour, she tells him off. Rancho and Pia save Raju's dying
      father; Raju reconciles with his friends while Pia falls in love with
      Rancho. The trio then writes exams the next day, but only Rancho tops,
      while Raju and Farhan score last. During a photography session of the
      batch, Rancho, who sits besides Virus and Chatur, earns a bet from Virus,
      who promises that he will get his mustache shaved.
    </p>
    <p>
      Farhan, Raju and Chatur, at present, finally reach Shimla. When they reach
      the Chanchad Palace, Rancho's residence, they instead end up encountering
      a very different man instead, who reveals that he is indeed Ranchhoddas
      Shamaldas Chanchad . Initially shocked, Farhan suddenly spots Rancho's
      degree on one of the walls, and below it, the same batch photograph they
      had clicked, but the trio is shocked to find that instead of Rancho, the
      image of this real Ranchhoddas has been morphed into it. Perplexed, Farhan
      and Raju inquire more about Rancho's location from Chatur, who reveals
      that in pursuit of a world renowned scientist, Phunsukh Wangdu, who has
      400 patents to his credit and is currently being searched by the Japanese
      and Chatur himself since a year to seek an appointment for a business
      proposal, he came to identify Rancho's location with the help of
      Phunsukh's secretary Tracy, and the two spot a photo given by Chatur in
      which Tracy had probably accidentally captured Rancho in her selfie.
      Farhan, convinced that there is more to the story than meets the eye,
      decides to confront the Ranchhoddas Shamaldas Chanchad they had just met.
      However, as this Ranchhoddas pulls out a rifle on Farhan and Raju, Chatur
      runs out of the Chanchad Palace in fear, but Farhan and Raju grab hold of
      Shamaldas Chanchad's ashes and threaten to pull a confession out of
      "Ranchhoddas", who ends up inadvertently confessing that he is actually
      the real Ranchhoddas Shamaldas Chanchad, and that the Ranchhoddas they
      knew, or rather addressed as Rancho, was actually Chhote, the son of their
      family gardener, who had a great interest in learning and would sit in on
      classes to accumulate knowledge. Once, when Chhote was caught by the
      school headmaster while solving a mathematical problem, he was summoned by
      the master to Shamaldas, who insisted that he be sent in lieu of
      Ranchoddas, who flew off and stayed in London for the four years that
      Chhote, or the "Rancho" they knew, masqueraded as Ranchhoddas Shamaldas
      Chanchad, so that the real Ranchhoddas could have a degree, while "Rancho"
      only wanted knowledge. Shamaldas also asked Chhote to cut off all contact
      with his ICE friends, but Chhote would always personally remind
      Ranchhoddas that, some day, two idiots would come looking for him, and he
      won't be able to stop that. Teary-eyed, Farhan and Raju promise to keep
      the real Ranchhoddas Shamaldas Chanchad's story a secret as he gives them
      Chhote's address, and reunite with Chatur, to whom they reveal that
      "Rancho" is in Ladakh, and the location is of a school, to which Chatur
      mockingly responds by concluding that Rancho is now a schoolteacher, and
      has probably failed the challenge.
    </p>
    <p>
      The film then flashes back to the past, when, one night during their final
      year, Farhan and Raju are upset that they are trailing behind in their
      grades every year and that Rancho is always in the front of every picture.
      Farhan and Raju accuse Rancho of not confessing his feelings to Pia, and
      they make a bet – if Rancho proposes to Pia, Raju will give up his
      meaningless rituals and multiple finger rings, while Farhan will confess
      to his father that he loves photography. The three friends drunkenly break
      into the Sahastrabuddhe residence after Rancho accepts the challenge. As
      the trio escapes, Virus recognises Raju and, on the next day, threatens to
      expel him unless he writes a letter recommending Rancho for expulsion.
      Unwilling to betray Rancho or disappoint his family, Raju unsuccessfully
      attempts suicide and ends up in a coma. With intensive care and support
      from his friends, Raju recovers just in time for his first job interview
      on the campus, which he succeeds in cracking. Meanwhile, Rancho and Pia
      post Farhan's letter to his favourite Hungarian wildlife photographer
      Andre Istvan, who offers him a position as an assistant. On Rancho's
      advice, he communicates his dream to his father, who though reluctant at
      first, gives his blessings for the sake of his son's happiness.
    </p>
    <p>
      Infuriated by this and Rancho's influence, Virus sets a difficult final
      exam paper to fail Raju, wherein Pia tries to help the trio by revealing
      to them the location of the exam paper in her father's office; the film
      flashes again to present day, when Farhan suddenly remembers Pia and
      convinces Raju during a minute's halt to get her to elope. They find out
      that Pia is getting married to Suhas, and gatecrash the ceremony secretly.
      Farhan confronts Pia and reveals to her that Rancho has been found, but
      while she initially conveys her opinion of a changed Suhas, she hears
      Suhas cry out after Raju, who has substituted himself as an imposter in
      place of one of the housekeeping staff members, intentionally ruins his
      wedding robe. He escapes, and later, manages to replace Suhas during the
      actual wedding. When he asks Pia to keep mum after revealing his identity,
      she gets afraid, and he ends up revealing himself. Virus is shocked, but
      Mona holds him back. Raju convinces Pia to run away so they can all
      reunite with Rancho, and Suhas turns up a second too late, as Pia and Raju
      are conversing. Finally, they elope, though they confuse Pia further when
      they state that they aren't sure if Rancho is married. Pia remains miffed.
    </p>
    <p>
      The film flashes back again to the past, when Farhan and Rancho
      successfully manage to steal a copy of the difficult question paper for
      Raju; unfortunately, Virus finds out and expels them all. Pia confronts
      Virus about her brother who had committed suicide because he couldn't meet
      Virus' expectation of clearing the engineering exam. That same night, the
      pregnant Mona goes into labour during a heavy storm that cuts off all
      traffic and electricity in the city. Rancho and the other students help
      them by using their engineering knowledge to quickly modify a vacuum
      cleaner into a ventouse and deliver the baby with the help of Pia over a
      video call. A grateful Virus finally acknowledges Rancho as an
      extraordinary student and revokes their expulsion. On graduation day,
      Rancho suddenly disappears shortly after the ceremony ends.
    </p>
    <p>
      Upon arrival in Ladakh, the four head to the village school and witness
      the young students' inventions, which resemble Chhote's college projects.
      While inquiring for Chhote, they stumble upon a lad who takes them to a
      room; the lad shows Farhan, now revealed to have become a successful
      wildlife photographer, his own books on wildlife which he wrote, and
      narrates that "Chhote" reads them regularly. He also shows Raju glimpses
      of his blogs, and narrates that "Chhote" proudly discusses Raju's research
      works with the kids. After similarly showing Pia her scooter helmet, he
      reveals that he is actually "Centimeter", a grown up Manmohan, who has now
      become a helper for Chhote after receiving a letter from him to help him.
      After a cheerful reunion between Farhan, Centimeter and Raju, Pia asks
      where Chhote is.
    </p>
    <p>
      Rancho is revealed to be flying a miniature plane when Pia rides a scooter
      to his location and passionately kisses him when he reveals that he has
      always been in love with her. Farhan and Raju initially hit Rancho and
      then hug each other out of joy, while Chatur, unaware of Chhote's secret
      and thinking he is Rancho, insults and asks Chhote to sign a contract
      stating that he is the least successful person; Chhote does so without
      commenting. As Chatur walks away triumphantly, the three friends ask
      Chhote what his real name is, and he reveals that he is Phunsukh Wangdu,
      much to the other three's surprise and delight. They try to stop Chatur,
      who continues leaving, so Phunsukh phones him, saying he can't sign a deal
      with his company. Realizing that Rancho is the real Phunsukh Wangdu, a
      horrified Chatur accepts his defeat and pleads him to sign his contract
      while Phunsukh and his friends run away laughing.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the end, Phunsukh tells everyone his theory: "Pursue excellence, and
      success will follow, pants down".
