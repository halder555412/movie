    <h1>Lagaan</h1>
    <p>
      Lagaan (transl. Agricultural Tax), released internationally as Lagaan:
      Once Upon a Time in India, is a 2001 Indian Hindi-language epic musical
      sports film written and directed by Ashutosh Gowariker, and produced by
      Aamir Khan. Khan stars along with debutant Gracy Singh, with British
      actors Rachel Shelley and Paul Blackthorne in supporting roles. Made on a
      then-unprecedented budget of ₹250 million[2] (US$5.32 million),[3] the
      movie was the maiden project from Aamir Khan Productions and was shot in
      villages near Bhuj.[4] The film is set in the early 1890s, during the late
      Victorian period of India's colonial British Raj. The story revolves
      around a small village in Central India, whose inhabitants, burdened by
      high taxes, and several years of drought, find themselves in an
      extraordinary situation as an arrogant British army officer challenges
      them to a game of cricket, as a wager to avoid paying the taxes they owe.
      The narrative spins around this situation as the villagers face the
      arduous task of learning a game that is alien to them and playing for a
      result that will change their village's destiny. Lagaan released on 15
      June 2001, clashing with Gadar: Ek Prem Katha starring Sunny Deol and
      Ameesha Patel. Lagaan received widespread critical acclaim and awards at
      international film festivals, as well as many Indian film awards. It
      became the third Indian film to be nominated for the Academy Award for
      Best Foreign Language Film after Mother India (1957) and Salaam Bombay!
      (1988)

    <h1>PLOT</h1>
    <p>
      In 1892, a delayed monsoon has rendered the farmers of Champaner unable to
      grow any crops. They pay a visit to local King Puran Singh to ask for
      exemption from the annual tax (lagaan), which has been doubled this year.
      The king, a nominal figure under the protection of the British Raj, is at
      the Cantonment where a cricket match is underway between British army
      officers. At the game, a young farmer named Bhuvan gets into a scuffle
      with one of the officers and ends up mocking the game in front of the
      commanding officer, Captain Andrew Russell. Enraged, the short-tempered
      Captain challenges Bhuvan to a match of cricket in exchange for cancelling
      lagaan. He raises the stakes by offering exemption from lagaan for the
      next three years should the farmers win, but also asking for a triple
      payment should the farmers lose. Bhuvan wittingly accepts the challenge.
      Informing his fellow villagers of the challenge, Bhuvan is met with
      incredulity; no one believes they will stand any chance of winning and
      they are terrified that the heavy tax burden will destroy their lives.
      Assembling a team proves to be difficult, as the only people to support
      Bhuvan are his mother and Gauri, the daughter of the village medic. The
      next day, Bhuvan puts up a public display of cricket in the village square
      and gains two supporters—Bagha, a strong drummer and Guran, an eccentric
      astrologer. To learn the rules of the game, they start secretly going to
      the cantonment to observe the playing officers. Unexpected help comes in
      the form of Captain Russell's sister, Elizabeth, a young woman who wants
      to give the farmers a fair chance by teaching them the game. With the help
      of an Indian translator, she starts meeting Bhuvan and his team at a
      ground outside their village. Soon, other villagers join the team. With a
      few weeks to go until the day of the match, Bhuvan is still missing one
      player and spots a hidden talent in Kachra, a cripple living on the
      fringes of the village. Kachra, bowling from his injured hand, can
      naturally spin the ball without difficulty. The other team members
      threaten a walkout because Kachra is also an untouchable, but Bhuvan
      reminds them of the high stakes of the match and expresses belief that
      Kachra will prove to be their team's strongest weapon. The day of the
      match arrives and the British army team elects to bat. The match has taken
      on a new dimension for Captain Russell, because he has been commanded by
      his superiors to pay the exempted lagaan from his own pocket should his
      team lose the match. The British team lose early wickets thanks to the
      unconventional bowling style of the farmers; however, they recover and end
      the day's play positively with Captain Russell leading the scoring.
      Kachra's bowling has been completely ineffective the whole day. At night,
      Elizabeth spies Lakha, a member of Bhuvan's team, talking to her brother
      in a conspiratorial manner. Lakha had been playing particularly poorly
      that day, and she informs Bhuvan of his betrayal. Angered, the villagers
      chase after Lakha to kill him but Bhuvan decides to give him another
      chance when Lakha confesses to being jealous of Gauri’s love for Bhuvan.
      The next day, Lakha redeems himself on the field and plays with great
      spirit. Kachra regains his ability to spin the ball, now that the ball has
      lost some of its hardness. He takes a hat-trick and some further quick
      wickets, and the British innings is over. The villagers' run chase starts
      promisingly, but soon the main batters, apart from Bhuvan, all lose their
      wickets before the end of the second day. The next day, steady and careful
      batting by Bhuvan and Ismail, an injured but capable player, gets them out
      of trouble. With victory now in sight, Ismail is run out, leaving Bhuvan
      to make the required runs with the last man, Kachra. With only one over
      left to play, Bhuvan loses strike and Kachra is forced to bat for the
      victory. With a boundary needed on the last ball, he only manages a
      single. However, the unbiased British umpire calls a no-ball (illegal
      delivery), putting Bhuvan on strike for the replayed delivery. He swings
      mightily, connects, and clears the boundary, thus winning the match for
      his team. In the coming weeks, with the villagers celebrating the end of
      lagaan, the British cantonment is disbanded, and the villagers watch as
      the British caravan departs from Champaner, seemingly forever. Elizabeth,
      who had fallen in love with Bhuvan, steps out to bid him a tearful
      farewell. She returns to England and never marries, while Gauri and Bhuvan
      get married with great fanfare in the village.
