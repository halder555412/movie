    <h1>Taare Zameen Par</h1>
    <p>
      Taare Zameen Par (titled Like Stars on Earth internationally) is a 2007
      Indian Hindi-language drama film produced and directed by Aamir Khan. The
      film explores the life and imagination of Ishaan, an 8-year-old dyslexic
      child. Although he excels in art, his poor academic performance leads his
      parents to send him to a boarding school. Ishaan's new art teacher
      suspects that he is dyslexic and helps him to overcome his disability.
      Darsheel Safary stars as 8-year-old Ishaan, and Aamir Khan plays his art
      teacher. Creative director and writer Amole Gupte initially developed the
      idea with his wife Deepa Bhatia, who served as the film's editor.
      Shankar–Ehsaan–Loy composed the film's score, and Prasoon Joshi wrote the
      lyrics for many of the songs. Principal photography took place in Mumbai
      and in Panchgani's New Era High School, and some of the school's students
      make appearances. The film made its theatrical debut in India on 21
      December 2007, and UTV Home Entertainment released a DVD for Indian
      audiences in 2008. Disney's later release of the international edition DVD
      marked the first purchase of distribution rights for an Indian film by a
      global company. Taare Zameen Par has received numerous awards, including
      the Filmfare Award for Best Film for 2008 and the 2008 National Film Award
      for Best Film on Family Welfare. It was India's official entry for the
      2009 Academy Awards Best Foreign Film, but did not progress to the
      short-list.

    <h1>PLOT</h1>
    <p>
      Ishaan Awasthi is an 8-year-old boy who hates school and learning, as he
      finds all the subjects difficult and is frequently belittled and disliked
      by both his teachers and his classmates. His imagination, creativity and
      talent for art and painting are often disregarded or unnoticed. His
      father, Nandkishore Awasthi, is a successful executive who expects his
      children to excel, and his mother, Maya Awasthi, is a housewife frustrated
      by her inability to educate Ishaan. Ishaan's elder brother, Yohaan
      Awasthi, is an exemplary student and athlete whose merits Ishaan is often
      ashamed of. After receiving a particularly poor academic report, Ishaan's
      parents sends him to a boarding school. There he rapidly sinks into a
      state of fear, anxiety and depression, despite being befriended by Rajan
      Damodharan, a physically disabled boy who is one of the top students in
      the class. Ishaan is anguished due to missing his parents, the boarding
      school teachers being even more abusive than the previous school's, and
      starting to feel that he genuinely was a failure. Ishaan contemplates
      suicide, climbing up the fence in a terrace, but Rajan intervenes, saving
      him. Ishaan's condition changes when a new art teacher, Ram Shankar
      Nikumbh, a cheerful and optimistic instructor at the Tulips School for
      young children with developmental disabilities, joins the school.
      Nikumbh's teaching style is markedly different from that of his strict and
      abusive predecessor, and he quickly observes Ishaan's unhappiness and
      impassive participation in class activities. He reviews Ishaan's work and
      concludes that his academic shortcomings are indicative of dyslexia, a
      condition suppressing his artistic capabilities. One day he sets off to
      Mumbai to visit Ishaan's parents where he is surprised to discover
      Ishaan's hidden interest in art after finding some of his drawings. Upset,
      he asks Nandkishore why he sent the child to a boarding school in the
      first place and shows Mrs Awasthi her son's notebooks giving an analysis
      of his struggles. He explains how Ishaan has severe difficulty in
      understanding letters and words due to dyslexia even though Nandkishore,
      labelling it as mental retardation, dismisses it as a mere excuse for
      laziness. Frustrated by his crude and inaccurate explanation of Ishaan's
      condition, Nikumbh leaves. Nandkishore finally feels guilty for his
      mistreatment towards Ishaan. Nikumbh returns and subsequently brings up
      the topic of dyslexia in a class by offering a list of famous people who
      were dyslexic. Afterwards, he comforts Ishaan by telling him how he
      struggled as a child as well by facing similar problems. Nikumbh then
      visits the school's principal and obtains his permission to become
      Ishaan's tutor. With gradual care, he attempts to improve Ishaan's reading
      and writing by using remedial techniques developed by dyslexia
      specialists. Ishaan soon develops an interest in his studies and
      eventually his grades improve. Towards the end of the school year, Nikumbh
      organises an art fair for the staff and students. The competition is
      judged by artist Lalita Lajmi. Ishaan, with his strikingly creative style,
      is declared the winner and Nikumbh, who paints Ishaan's portrait, is
      declared the runner-up. The principal announces that Nikumbh has been
      hired as the school's permanent art teacher. When Ishaan's parents meet
      his teachers on the last day of school they are left speechless by the
      transformation they see in him. Overcome with emotion, Mr. Awasthi thanks
      Nikumbh. As Ishaan gets into the car to leave with his parents for summer
      vacations, he turns around and runs toward Nikumbh, who gives him a hug
      and tells him to return next year.
